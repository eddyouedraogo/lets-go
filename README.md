# Let's Go
Let's Go is a travel app built to help user's plan their trips and accompany users during their trips.

The main goals of this app will be to :
  * Allow users to enter their desired destinations
  * Retrieve or allow user to enter their current location
  * Fetch data and set price alert for the selected destinations
  * Propose activities to do at this destination
    * List of activities with checks
    * Allow users to provide feedback on the activity
    * Best time to go there ...
  * Allow user to build a travel itinary (multiple destination, change or add activities, ...)
  * Booking hotels (???)
  * Group trip (???)
  
In the future we would ultimately like to be able to propose hotel booking, and allow users to plan group trip and alllow us to manage the hotel, flight, restaurant(maybe) bookings for the trip.
Also allow users to communicate with their friends through the app in group booking. 
Allow users to communicate with locals before their arrivals ???
